mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as ebx + ecx * 4.  If ecx is sufficiently large, this calculation could overflow, leading to an access violation or unexpected behavior.  The overflow can occur either because ecx is a negative value, or it's a positive value but the resulting address exceeds the available memory.
